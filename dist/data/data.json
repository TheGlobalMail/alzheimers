My careers have included working as a nurse in dementia and aged care, and in operating theatres for over 20 years, as a chef in my own hospitality business for 10 years, and then as an executive in health care sales. In 2004, I was working full time, studying a double tertiary degree, caring for school age children and running our home with my husband, and volunteering. My life was interesting, busy and very fulfilling. I speak out now because the only way you can understand me is to walk in my shoes, and because there is a gross under-representation of people with dementia, my philosophy now being “nothing about us, without us”.</p>\n<p>In 2006, I started spelling that wrong (atht &#8211; taht) and becoming confused about the use of words like <em>there</em> and <em>their</em>, and other very simple word mistakes. I was seeing numbers back to front, and words in new ways, for example castle as cast and lee. I had been exceptional at language, and losing these skills was confusing. When I was sent for my first MRI in 2007, I was not even insightful enough to have realised I was being checked for Alzheimer’s disease. The first batch of neuropsychology tests showed my memory was just below average for someone my age, which was truly devastating, but treated very glibly. Then with increasing features prominent to dementia including impaired cognition and comprehension, mild speech difficulties and language dysfunction, increasing episodic memory loss, mild anomia, and surface dyslexia, I was re-examined in 2008.</p>\n<p>Compensation for these disabilities was initially very easy, but further brain scans and neuropsych tests showed increased deficits in the semantic categories, increased anomia, object and auditory agnosia, increased surface dyslexia, and prosody. I also had small behavioural changes and my number cognition was impaired. Eventually, in 2008 aged 49, I was diagnosed with a fronto temporal dementia, probably semantic, a rare debilitating terminal illness.  This was followed up with a second neurologist and neuropsychologist interstate who re-confirmed the diagnosis in 2009. To say it has been a roller coaster ride is probably an understatement! Of course, the only way to know 100 per cent that someone has dementia is with a brain biopsy (autopsy), which I’m not quite ready for!</p>\n<p>My husband talks about it being a ‘threesome’ how the three of us co-exist, about how it is not an ideal situation as most people know two’s company and three is more often than not a crowd. He said recently, it’s important to remember that the person he loves is not causing these changes, it is the dementia, and it is not my fault that I have dementia, but he’s not overly fond of our new lodger! I nicknamed this threesome The Three Stooges!! My (and our) life has changed in ways that are challenging to understand and live with, and I now try to live every day as if it’s my last, just in case it is.</p>\n<p>The changes brought on by dementia are relentless, yet most people don’t see them as disabilities just as external symptoms. Many also think it is a mental illness, which it is not. The word Dementia is taken from Latin, originally meaning &#8220;madness&#8221;; no wonder we struggle against the myths! And so, we are regularly defined by the symptoms of our disease; forgetful, confused, aggressive, odd behaviour, absconders or refusing to communicate, rather than the people we still are… mothers, fathers, lovers, daughters, wives or husbands, employees or employers, grandmothers, aunties. It is a tragedy that so many just see our deficits. The feeling that my life is slipping away from me is almost tangible and I do sometimes feel cheated.  Losing my legs and arms or my sight or hearing might be better than this hideous disease. When I was first diagnosed, the tears ran down my cheeks, non-stop for weeks, and I used to think “‘if only someone would tell me it is just depression or some bizarre mental illness… anything other than dementia”.</p>\n<p>My husband lives with an ever deepening sorrow, as he watches from the sidelines, trying to support me without ‘minimising’ me. He tries to hide or block out his grief as we strive to live the best way we can, but I can see the intense sadness in his eyes, feel it in his hugs, see it in the way he sometimes sits and holds his head in his hands or stares at me when he thinks I am not looking. Recently he wrote in an email, “I know I am losing you and am afraid of what the future holds”. Our philosophy is to try and live in the now and be happy and enjoy every single moment. My children mostly act as if nothing is wrong, and manage any obvious changes as best they can. Our way of coping is to use humour; for example they introduce me to their friends as the ‘Dementor’ in the family (from the Harry Potter books). In fact if you have seen those movies, the dementers perfectly represent in a visual way how it feels inside, as if the dementia is sucking the life and goodness out of my soul. My mother was interviewed in 2009, and said she was horrified and angry when she was told of my dementia, she said it was “an anger that she had never felt before, an anger that would not go away… then the anger subsided and I was left with a deep, deep sadness … I cannot contemplate what lies ahead …”</p>\n<p>Writing, speaking and blogging has ensured I retain and foster positive relationships and emotions, especially blogging as it opens the door to communication, often found to be deficit in people with dementia, and allows me to not only record, but to recall my own world, a permanent memory bank. It is clear to me dementia would be better managed with positive psychology used to promote individually perceived wellness and happiness, especially following initial diagnosis. I manage my health with a regime of non pharmacological and positive psychosocial activities, including neuroplasticity exercises, via education and hydrotherapy, blogging, counselling, Transcendental Meditation, self-hypnosis, nutrition, regular exercise, volunteering, phenomenology, and recreational engagement that is meaningful to me like reading and music.</p>\n<p>I am a person living with dementia, with the emphasis on LIVING. Because the future is now defined by the <em>possibilities</em> of the dementia, we need to live more in the now. We are living our own lives, trying to be as ‘normal’ as possible, in spite of the fact we may have lost many of the dreams and aspirations we might have had. Yes, I have a terminal illness, and am likely to die earlier than we would have expected, BUT why die now? Being born is also a death sentence, and I often say “we live until we die<em>”</em>! My life continues to be interesting, busy and very fulfilling.
