    <p>When Charlie Chaplin received a letter from another old man in 1971, he secreted it in a locked drawer. Perhaps bemused by a sliver of an unknowable past, he certainly was not muted by shame. Read by the great comedian’s daughter after his death in 1977, the letter gave evidence of a Roma lineage, already asserted by Chaplin in his autobiography. But the letter’s author went further.</p>
