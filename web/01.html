			<h1>The long goodbye: <span>A personal look at Alzheimers</span></h1>

			<p class="intro">A four-letter flare-up can cost you as much as running a red light - and the filthy-mouth money flows into state coffers. Given some of the language used in parliament, don't we have to ask: is maintaining order really at risk from modern expression?</p>
			<span class="divider"></span>
			<p>Some words can't be aired in public without causing offence, and most of us bloody well know what they are.
			Take cattle boss David Farley's speech in Adelaide this month, where he compared the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard to a "non-productive old cow"; offence was inevitable. Within the room, the comment was reportedly met with laughter.</p>
			<p>But across the media it was described as "sexist and silly" and a sign of "destructive prejudices long past their use-by date in our modern, diverse society". Farley says the comment was taken out of context.</p>
			<p>True enough, where you use words, and to whom you say them, makes all the difference in the offence.</p>
			<p>There is a kind of social swearing among friends - "You silly old bugger" - that some linguists refer to as "verbal cuddling". There are the expletives you use when you are stuck in traffic or hit your thumb with a hammer. And of course there is abusive language reserved for when you really want to wound someone.</p>
			<p>Many people would be surprised to find out what any of these words could cost them - literally, that they can be fined or arrested for using offensive language in a public place.</p>
			<p>In every state and territory of Australia, it is an offence to be offensive. Whether police or a court would consider the type of language that Farley used an offence is an interesting question. If history is any indicator, public figures will continue to make offensive blunders without ever being issued a fine.</p>
			<p>So, who decides what is offensive? In many states, it's up to police discretion.</p>
			<p>In New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, police can issue on-the-spot fines for offensive language. And as far as many civil rights groups are concerned, that is part of the [expletive] problem - that police, who are often the victims of the offence, are also the arbiters of it.</p>
			<p>You only have to put these numbers together to see that NSW police are in charge of a million-dollar swear jar. In 2011, the state revenue collected a staggering $1.23 million in fines for offensive or indecent language.
			<p>Other states are more coy about their windfalls due to bad-language. Since such fines were trialled in Victoria in 2008, police in that state have issued 2,705 fines for "the offence of using profane, indecent or obscene language in public", says a spokesperson for the Victorian Department of Justice.</p>
			<p>While the department could not provide a total amount for the money collected from fines, a rough estimate using the 2008 fine amount of $238.90 (which rose to $282 in July 2012) generates a figure of more than $640,000 in revenue.</p>
			<p>"While some people may object to these words, the case for making their use an offence must be weakened considerably by the frequency of their appearance in popular songs, television programs, novels, radio and even in public discourse," the Commission's report notes.</p>
			<p>The Commission's final report, published in February, called for a separate inquiry into whether or not offences for offensive language should be abolished.</p>
			<p>The NSW Attorney General's office told The Global Mail that it does not believe an inquiry is warranted and has no plans to abolish the law: "People have the right to use public places free from verbal abuse," a spokesperson for the NSW Attorney General, Greg Smith, said. "The job of a police officer is difficult enough without having to put up with offensive language."</p>
